# Friday Project 7

## Files
 1. signupPage.py: Script to create the sign-up page for users.
 2. signinPage.py: Script to create sign-in page for users.
 3. usersinfo.db: Script to create the database and tables.
 4. usersinfo.sql: Script to create and populate the table.

## How to run:
  1. Run signupPage.py to create profile with email and password. It will automatically direct you to the sign-in page. Make sure you provide the proper credentials (@, .com) or you will get a displayed error.
  2. Exit the sign-in page and run signinPage.py. Enter your email and password and it will prompt you whether you entered your log-in correct(Green) or incorrect(Red).
     + Must perform this step (Exiting the initial sign-in page and re-opening) in order to know if you entered your log-in correctly.
